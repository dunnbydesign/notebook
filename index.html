        <h2>What I want to learn in the Primer Basic course</h2>
        <p>
          I have experience with tools such as MS-DOS, Visual Basic, and SQL. I have also recently learned how to build a website, CSS Basics, and Console on the Treehouse website. I am enrolled in the Full Stack JavaScript Immersion course that starts in August. My goal is to become a junior web developer as quickly as possible after I complete the immersion course. I am hoping that I can learn real-world use cases for the topics I learn in this Primer Basic class, and that I get very familiar with the team/project aspects of the web development life cycle. My goal is to be exposed to as much practical work as possible to get me ready for entering the workplace with a strong start. I believe confidence in my abilities and a good understanding of how the profession operates are key to my success as I compete for jobs alongside computer science graduates and seasoned industry professionals. I am very thrilled to learn the numerous skills involved with web development. I hope that I can become a master of JavaScript and its related frameworks, and then eventually learn other web and app development languages. My goal is also to learn how each programming language operates so that I can better understand new languages that I learn in the future.

        <h2>My concerns</h2>
        <p>
          I have limited confidence in my ability to make a website look stylish. The majority of my work experience has been centered around publishing information in a purely functional format.

        <h2>Every card has a title</h2>
        <p>
          This card has a <b>paragraph</b> of <span class="redText">text</span> with a <a href="http://www.google.com">link</a>. It also has a <i>second</i> <span class="underlineText">sentence</span> of <span class="strikethroughText">text</span> with a <a href="http://www.portlandcodeschool.com">link</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A card is a simple unit of information. We'll use the &lt;article&gt; tag to represent a card and then style it with CSS.

        <h2>Every card has a width</h2>
        <p>
          <b>But</b> we <i>never</i> use pixels ("px") to determine the size of a card.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use  measurements that <i>flex</i>, like percents (%), or that relate to the size of the content, like <i>root "em"</i> units (rem), which relate the size of the element to the text size and thus make the card very readable.

        <h2>This card has lists</h2>
        <p class="leadstolist">
          Lists are everywhere in web applications. They are used for navigation (a list of links):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.facebook.com">go here</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.twitter.com">go there</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com">go someplace else</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Or as a way to display sets of things
        </p>
        <p class="leadstolist">
          My favorite colors
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="redText">red</span></li>
          <li><span class="blueText">blue</span></li>
          <li><span class="greenText">green</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You will use lists a lot.
